# Standard Deviation

{% hint style="success" %}
Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are. 
{% endhint %}

It is the square root of the [Variance](variance.md). It is often more convenient than the variance because it has the same unit as the data points.

**Population Standard Deviation**, $$\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}\sum_i^n(x_{i}-\mu)^2$$ 

**Sample Standard Deviation**, $$\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{1-n}}\sum_i^n(x_{i}-\overline{x})^2$$
