It splits the data into quarters.
{% endhint %}

**Steps to transform data into quartiles:**

1. Sort the numbers. 
2. Cut the list into quarters. 
3. Start to Q1, Q2, Q3 to end. 

**The Quartiles also divide the data into divisions of 25%, so:**

* Quartile 1 \(Q1\) can be called the **25th percentile**
* Quartile 2 \(Q2\) can be called the **50th percentile**
* Quartile 3 \(Q3\) can be called the **75th percentile**

### Ranges

The range of data is the difference between the maximum and the minimum element in the dataset. The **interquartile range** is the difference between the **first** and **third** quartile.
