# Central Limit Theorem

{% hint style="success" %}
It states that the average of the sample means will be equal to the population mean.
{% endhint %}

Irrespective of how the population data points are distributed, the plot of sample means will always look like a normal distribution. 

**For a normal distribution, we know that,**

* Mean, Median and Mode are equal 
* Data is symmetric about the mean 

Using these properties we can draw inferences about the population as a whole.
