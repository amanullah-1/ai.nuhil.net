# Deciles

{% hint style="success" %}
Deciles are similar to Percentiles, as they split the data into 10% groups.
{% endhint %}

**The 1st decile** is the 10th percentile \(the value that divides the data so that 10% is below it\).

**The 2nd decile** is the 20th percentile \(the value that divides the data so that 20% is below it\). Etc!
