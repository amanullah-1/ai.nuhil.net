# Scaler vs Vector

A vector has a magnitude and direction.

The length of the line shows its magnitude and the arrowhead points in the direction.

We can add two vectors by joining them head-to-tail:

![vector add a+b](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/images/vector-add.svg)

And it doesn't matter which order we add them, we get the same result:
