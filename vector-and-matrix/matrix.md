### Multiplying a Matrix by Another Matrix

Need to do the "dot product" of rows and columns.

## Dividing a Matrix by Another Matrix

We don't do that. Rather we make the inverse of the denominator matrix and then multiply it with the numerator matrix.

## Inverse of a Matrix

**2x2 Matrix.** The inverse of a 2x2 is easy compared to larger matrices \(such as a 3x3, 4x4, etc\). For those larger matrices there are other methods to work out the inverse.

Very much helpful if we want to get an unknown matrix such as X where,$$XA = B$$ by $$X = BA^{-1}$$ 

## Determinant of a Matrix

The determinant of a matrix is a special number that can be calculated from a square matrix. The determinant helps us find the inverse of a matrix, tells us things about the matrix that are useful in systems of linear equations, calculus and more.
