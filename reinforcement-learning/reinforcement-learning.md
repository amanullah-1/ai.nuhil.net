# Reinforcement Learning

{% hint style="success" %}
Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing certain actions and learning from the results of those actions.
{% endhint %}

When the agent takes action, it gets the reward on the basis of the result. This way the learning process continues depending on the positive and the negative reward. The learning is based on interaction with the environment. The agent discovers which action will give the maximum reward. Depending on that, the agent takes action.
