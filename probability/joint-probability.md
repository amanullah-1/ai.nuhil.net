# Joint Probability

{% hint style="success" %}
Joint probability is the probability of two events happening together.
{% endhint %}

The two events are usually designated event A and event B. In probability terminology, it can be written as:

$$
P(A \cap B) =P(A,B) = P(A|B)*P(B)
$$

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** The probability that a card is a five and black = p\(five and black\) 
{% endhint %}

2/52 = 1/26  
\(There are two black fives in a deck of 52 cards, the five of spades and the five of clubs\).
