# Conditional Probability

{% hint style="success" %}
Conditional probability is the likelihood of an event A to occur given that another event that has a relation with event A has already occurred.
{% endhint %}

Suppose that we have 6 blue balls and 4 yellows placed in two boxes as seen below. I ask you to randomly pick a ball. The probability of getting a blue ball is 6 / 10 = 0,6. What if I ask you to pick a ball from box A? The probability of picking a blue ball clearly decreases. The condition here is to pick from box A which clearly changes the probability of the event \(picking a blue ball\). The probability of event A given that event B has occurred is denoted as p\(A\|B\).

$$
P(A|B) = \frac {P(A,B)}{P(B)} = \frac {P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
