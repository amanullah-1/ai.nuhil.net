# T-SNE

### Stochastic Neighbor Embedding

{% hint style="success" %}
T-SNE is a machine learning algorithm for data visualization \(usually\), which is based on a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique. 
{% endhint %}

The basic idea of t-SNE is to reduce dimensional space keeping relative pairwise distance between points. In other words, the algorithm maps multi-dimensional data to two or more dimensions, where points which were initially far from each other are also located far away, and close points are also converted to close ones. 

> It can be said that t-SNE looking for a new data representation where the neighborhood relations are preserved.
