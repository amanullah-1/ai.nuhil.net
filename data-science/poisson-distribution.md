# Poisson Distribution

{% hint style="success" %}
It is a discrete distribution function describing the probability that an event will occur a certain number of times in a fixed time \(or space\) interval.
{% endhint %}

Poisson distributions can be used to predict how many times an event might occur in a given time period. 

* The number \(r\) of hits on a website in one hour with an average hit rate of 6 hits per hour is poisson distributed.
* Insurance companies to conduct risk analysis \(eg. predict the number of car crash accidents within a predefined time span\) to decide car insurance pricing.

**Poisson Process:** The timing of the next event is completely independent of when the previous event happened.
